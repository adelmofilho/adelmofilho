> I am the bone of my code <br /> 
POG is my body, coffee is my blood <br /> 
I have created over a thounsand code lines <br /> 
Unkown to git, nor known to PEP <br /> 
Have withstood bugs to create many defs <br /> 
Yet those Hands will never deploy Anything. <br /> 
So, as I Pray... <br /> 
Unlimited Code Works
